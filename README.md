# Global optimization of SVM with RBF kernel parameters
The goal of this project is to compare some algorithms for global optimization to optimize the C and gamma parameter of a Support Vector Machine classifier with radial basis function kernel.

This project is in Python3 and written using Jupyter Notebook.

# Requirements Libraries
1. matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/)
2. numpy (http://www.numpy.org/)
3. scikit-learn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
4. scipy (https://www.scipy.org/)

It's raccomanded to update all this library to the latest stable version. The dual annealing algorithm is new in scipy 1.2.0.
